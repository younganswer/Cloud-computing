# Cloud computing

Cloud computing is an innovative technology that allows you to access and manage computing resources over the Internet. By utilising cloud services, you can increase flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

One of the main benefits of cloud computing is high availability. By distributing resources across multiple data centres and geographies, cloud providers ensure that applications remain accessible and operational in the event of hardware failure or other disruptions. This redundancy and fault tolerance is critical to maintaining business continuity and providing a seamless user experience.

Cloud computing also supports a variety of services, including infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), function-as-a-service(FaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). These services provide the building blocks for developing, deploying, and managing applications in a highly efficient and scalable manner.

In this repository, you'll find practical examples and labs related to cloud computing, including containerisation and serverless architectures.
